# A tutorial for the development of regression models in machine learning


## Objectives
1. How to define your problem
2. How to choose a appropriate model
3. How to evaluate the model performance
4. How to save your model for re-use

### We are not going to cover
1. classification problem
2. deep learning models

#### In this tutorial, we are going to use the case from Li, G., et al (2019) (https://doi.org/10.1021/acssynbio.9b00099), which tried to predict optimal growth temperature of microoganisms from their proteomes. 


#### Dependences
* sklearn
* seaborn
* pandas
* Python 3
